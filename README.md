# HNG Mobile Internship Project

I've created a Flutter mobile application that showcases my Slack identity, integrates my Slack profile picture, and includes a "Open GitHub" button to view my GitHub profile.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Flutter installed. If you haven't already, you can install Flutter by following the [official installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emjaycodes/profile_app.git
cd profile_app
```

### Running the App
Use the following commands to run the app on an emulator or physical device:
flutter pub get
flutter run

## Assumptions Made
I assumed that you have a basic understanding of Flutter and have it set up on your system.
The Slack identity and GitHub URL are static for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, these would be fetched from an API or user input.

## App Features
The app prominently displays my Slack name and profile picture.
There's a "Open GitHub" button that takes you to my GitHub profile.
The "Open GitHub" button changes color when pressed for user feedback.
